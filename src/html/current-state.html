            <p>
                On June 24, 2022, the Supreme Court came to a decision on the case Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization.
                The case itself was a challenge to a 2018 Mississippi law that stated abortions are illegal after 15 weeks of pregnancy. 
                The Jackson Women's Health Organization (the only abortion clinic in Mississippi at the time) argued that the law
                was unconstitutional under the precedent set by Roe v. Wade and Planned Parenthood v. Casey. However, the Supreme Court
                came to the conclusion that under the Constitution of the United States, abortion is not a protected right. From this point
                onward, abortion was no longer a federally protected right. 
            </p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>
                Following the decision, the legality of abortion fell back to the States laws. Since then, 12 States
                have made abortion illegal. Most of these have exceptions in place for pregnancies that danger the 
                life of the mother or are a result of rape/incest, but not all.

            <p class="h1"> <img src="../content/bullet.png" alt="bullet-tn"> What this Means in Tennessee</p>
            <p>
                In 2019, the State of Tennessee passed the "Human Life Protection Act" or HLPA. The act is a trigger law that once Roe v. Wade
                is overturned, the act would become law for the state of Tennessee. Once Roe v. Wade was overturned on June 24 of 2022,
                the act became law in Tennessee on August 25, 2022, making abortion a class C Felony for the person performing the procedure. 
            </p>
            <p>
                As it currently stands, there are a very limited number of exceptions to this law. Those few are:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li> <strong>To save the life of the pregnant person:</strong> 
                    <ul>
                        <li>An abortion is permitted if a licensed physician determines it is necessary to prevent the death of the pregnant woman.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li> <strong>To prevent serious risk of substantial and irreversible impairment of a major bodily function of the pregnant person:</strong> 
                    <ul>
                        <li>Abortion is allowed to prevent a condition that would create a serious This exception is for the pregnant person's physical health, not mental health.</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                There is also no exceptions on any pregnancy that is the result of rape or incest.
