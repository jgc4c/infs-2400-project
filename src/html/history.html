            <p>
                The earliest major item in the timeline of Reproductive Rights in Tennessee is in 1938 when the first birth control clinic associated with health and welfare services was built.
                This clinic was built in Nashville and likely operated under the umbrella of the Tennessee Department of Health or similar agency at the time, as there doesn't appear to be
                a name for the clinic readily available. 
            </p>
            <p>
                There also isn't any images readily available of this clinic either. Again, most likely because it operated under some Tennessee Agency 
                rather than it's own specific name. The image shown is of a Nashville Physician's Office from the 1930's, so it is possible 
                that this birth control clinic could have looked similar.
            </p>
            <p>
                The services offered at this clinic would likely include:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Contraceptive Information and Counseling</li>
                <li>Distribution of Contraceptives</li>
                <li>Pelvic Examinations</li>
                <li>Basic Reproductive Health Education</li>
                <li>Prenatal Care Information</li>

            <p class="h1"> <img src="../content/bullet.png" alt="bullet-tn"> Abortion</p>
            <p>
                The next major item in the timeline comes with the decision of Supreme Court case Roe v. Wade on January 22, 1973.
                The ruling stated that an abortion performed prior to the point of fetal viabilty was a protected right under
                the Constitution of the United States. This ruling set the legality of abortion at the Federal level, meaning state
                laws on abortion no longer applied, which led to the first Tennessee abortion clinic being built in Memphis in 1974. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The clinic was opened under the name of the Memphis Center for Reproductive Health, later renamed to just CHOICES after 2009.
                The clinic's primarly function was to provide abortion services, but also provided other reproductive health services like 
                counseling, pregnancy testing, and birth control services. In 1975, a similar clinic was opened in Knoxville which provided 
                the same services. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The amount of these clinics has declined over the years:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>1982: 128 clinics</li>
                <li>1992: 33 clinics</li>
                <li>2014: 7 clinics</li>
            </ul>
