            <p>
                The earliest major item in the timeline of Reproductive Rights in Tennessee is in 1938 when the first birth control clinic associated with health and welfare services was built.
                This clinic was built in Nashville and likely operated under the umbrella of the Tennessee Department of Health or similar agency at the time, as there doesn't appear to be
                a name for the clinic readily available. 
            </p>
            <p>
                There also isn't any images readily available of this clinic either. Again, most likely because it operated under some Tennessee Agency 
                rather than it's own specific name. The image shown is of a Nashville Physician's Office from the 1930's, so it is possible 
                that this birth control clinic could have looked similar.
            </p>
            <p>
                The services offered at this clinic would likely include:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Contraceptive Information and Counseling</li>
                <li>Distribution of Contraceptives</li>
                <li>Pelvic Examinations</li>
                <li>Basic Reproductive Health Education</li>

            <br>
            <p>
                The next major item in the timeline comes with the decision of Supreme Court case Roe v. Wade on January 22, 1973.
                The ruling stated that an abortion performed prior to the point of fetal viabilty was a protected right under
                the Constitution of the United States. This ruling set the legality of abortion at the Federal level, meaning state
                laws on abortion no longer applied.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                The case came about when Norma McCorvey (under the legal pseudonym Jane Roe) was pregnant with her third child and wanted an abortion. However, since McCorvey 
                lived in Texas where abortion was illegal except in circumstances where the mother's life is in danger, she was unable to.
                McCorvey's lawyers filed a lawsuit on her behald against her local district attorney, Henry Wade, in which they alleged 
                that Texas's abortion laws were unconstitutional.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                When the decision came in January of 1973, the Supreme Court ruled in favor of McCorvey stating that the 
                "Due Process Clause" of the 14th amendment provides a fundamental "right to privacy", which then in turn 
                protects a women's right to an abortion prior to fetal viability.

            <br>
            <p>
                Following the ruling of Roe v. Wade, the first abortion clinic was built in Memphis in 1974.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                The clinic was opened under the name of the Memphis Center for Reproductive Health, later renamed to just CHOICES after 2009.
                The clinic's primarly function was to provide abortion services, but also provided other reproductive health services like 
                counseling, pregnancy testing, and birth control services. In 1975, a similar clinic was opened in Knoxville which provided 
                the same services. 
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                The amount of abortion clinics in Tennessee has declined over the years:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>1982: 128 clinics</li>
                <li>1992: 33 clinics</li>

            <p>
                Planned Parenthood v. Casey was another Supreme Case that arose in 1992 as a reponse to the 
                Pennsylvania Abortion Control Act of 1982. The case challenged five provisions of the Pennsylvanian Act
                where it was argued that they were unconstitutional under the legal precedent of Roe v. Wade. Those five provisions are: 
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li> <strong>§ 3205's Informed Consent</strong> - a woman seeking abortion had to give her informed consent prior to the procedure. </li>
                <li> <strong>§ 3209's Spousal Notice</strong> - a married woman seeking abortion had to sign a statement declaring that she had notified her husband prior to undergoing the procedure, unless certain exceptions applied.</li>
                <li> <strong>§ 3206's Parental Consent</strong> - minors had to get the informed consent of at least one parent or guardian prior to the abortion procedure. Alternatively, minors could seek judicial bypass in lieu of consent.</li>
                <li> <strong>§ 3203's Medical Emergency Definition</strong> - defining a medical emergency as "[t]hat condition, which, on the basis of the physician's good faith clinical judgment, so complicates the medical condition of a pregnant woman as to necessitate the immediate abortion of her pregnancy to avert her death or for which a delay will create serious risk of substantial and irreversible impairment of a major bodily function."</li>
                <li> <strong>§§ 3207(b), 3214(a), and 3214(f)'s Reporting Requirements</strong> - certain reporting and record keeping mandates were imposed on facilities providing abortion services.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                On June 29, 1992, the Supreme Court ruled in favor of Planned Parenthood, upholding the legality set by Roe v. Wade.
                In addition to this, it also set the restoration of the "undue burden standard" when evaluating state-imposed restrictions 
                on that right. In short, it means that States are not allowed to pass laws that make getting an abortion a lengthy or difficult
                process, i.e. a burden.
